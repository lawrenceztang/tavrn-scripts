Speaker 0: Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Mira Law Firm. This is Sally. May I have your full name, please?  
Speaker 1: Hi. My name is Sarah Hernandez.  
Speaker 0: Thank you, Ms. Hernandez. What's the best phone number to reach you?  
Speaker 1: It's (415) 555-9889.  
Speaker 0: And an email address?  
Speaker 1: sarah.hernandez@proton.me.  
Speaker 0: Great. For verification, could you give me your date of birth?  
Speaker 1: September 2nd, 1991.  
Speaker 0: Thanks. Now, can you briefly describe what happened that led to your injury?  
Speaker 1: Sure. On May 29, 2025, I was at Harborview Mall in Oakland. A floor tile near the escalator was loose and sticking up. I caught my foot on it, fell forward, and landed hard. There were no cones or warning signs around it.  
Speaker 0: I'm sorry that happened. What injuries did you sustain?  
Speaker 1: I fractured my left wrist and sprained my right knee. I also have bruising along my hip.  
Speaker 0: Did you receive medical treatment?  
Speaker 1: Yes. An ambulance took me to UCSF Medical Center that afternoon. They put my wrist in a cast, did X-rays on my knee, and prescribed pain medication.  
Speaker 0: Understood. Are you still treating?  
Speaker 1: Yes. Iâ€™m in physical therapy twice a week, and I have a follow-up with an orthopedist in two weeks.  
Speaker 0: Do you have health insurance?  
Speaker 1: I do. Kaiser Permanente, policy number KP-4429-58.  
Speaker 0: And did you miss any work because of the incident?  
Speaker 1: Yes, I missed ten workdays and had to use short-term disability.  
Speaker 0: What is your employer's name and your position?  
Speaker 1: I'm a marketing analyst at Golden Gate Tech Solutions.  
Speaker 0: On a scale of one to 10, what's your pain level today?  
Speaker 1: Around a six, mostly because of the knee.  
Speaker 0: Got it. We're almost done. May I get the mall's address if you have it?  
Speaker 1: Yes, it's 7800 Embarcadero Drive, Oakland, California 94607.  
Speaker 0: Perfect. We'll review your case right away. The next step is to send you a HIPAA release and contingency fee agreement for electronic signature so we can obtain your records and move forward. Does that sound okay?  
Speaker 1: Yes, that works for me.  
Speaker 0: Great. You'll receive an email with further instructions within the next few minutes. If you have any questions, reply to those messages or call me at the number on your caller ID. Anything else I can help with today?  
Speaker 1: No, I think that's everything. Thank you for your assistance.  
Speaker 0: You're welcome, Ms. Hernandez. Take care, and we'll be in touch soon.
