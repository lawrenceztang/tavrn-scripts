Speaker 0: Thanks. Now, can you briefly describe what happened that led to your injury?

Speaker 1: On May 07, 2025, I tripped over a loose floorboard at the entrance of a restaurant called The Rustic Table. There were no warning signs or barriers.

Speaker 0: I'm sorry to hear that. What injuries did you sustain?

Speaker 1: I injured my left knee and sprained my wrist when I tried to break my fall.

Speaker 0: Did you receive medical treatment?

Speaker 1: Yes. I went to the emergency room at County General Hospital that evening. They did an MRI and referred me to an orthopedic specialist.

Speaker 0: Understood. Are you still treating?

Speaker 1: Yes. I've been seeing Dr. Alan Chen for my knee, and I have a follow-up appointment next week.

Speaker 0: Do you have health insurance?

Speaker 1: I do. It's with United Healthcare, policy number UH-1234-5678.

Speaker 1: I'm a software engineer at Tech Innovations Inc.

Speaker 0: Thanks. On a scale of one to 10, what's your pain level today?

Speaker 1: I'd say it's around a six.

Speaker 0: Got it. We're almost done. May I get the restaurant's address if you have it?

Speaker 1: It's 789 Main Street, Walnut Creek, California 94596.

Speaker 0: Perfect. We'll review your case right away. The next step is to send you a HIPAA release and contingency fee agreement for electronic signature so we can obtain your records and move forward. Does that sound okay?

Speaker 1: Yes, that's fine.
