Speaker 0: Thanks. Now, can you briefly describe what happened that led to your injury?

Speaker 1: On May 21st, 2025, I tripped over a loose floorboard at the entrance of a restaurant called The Rustic Table. There were no signs or warnings about the hazard.

Speaker 0: I'm sorry to hear that. What injuries did you sustain?

Speaker 1: I injured my left knee and sprained my wrist when I tried to catch myself.

Speaker 0: Did you receive medical treatment?

Speaker 1: Yes. I went to Mercy General Hospital later that day. They did an MRI and referred me to Dr. Alan Chen, an orthopedic specialist.

Speaker 0: Understood. Are you still treating?

Speaker 1: Yes. I've had two follow-up appointments and I'm scheduled for physical therapy next week.

Speaker 0: Do you have health insurance?

Speaker 1: I do. It's with United Healthcare, policy number UH-1234-5678.

Speaker 1: I'm a software engineer at Tech Innovations Inc.

Speaker 0: Thanks. On a scale of one to 10, what's your pain level today?

Speaker 1: It's 5678 Elm Street, Sacramento, California 95814.

Speaker 0: Perfect. We'll review your case right away. The next step is to send you a HIPAA release and contingency fee agreement for electronic signature so we can obtain your records and move forward. Does that sound okay?
