Speaker 0: Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Mira Law Firm. This is Sally. May I have your full name, please?  
Speaker 1: Hi, my name is Emily Hernandez.  

Speaker 0: Thank you, Ms. Hernandez. What's the best phone number to reach you?  
Speaker 1: It’s (925) 555-9534.  

Speaker 0: And an email address?  
Speaker 1: emily.hernandez@yahoo.com.  

Speaker 0: Great. For verification, could you give me your date of birth?  
Speaker 1: June 2nd, 1990.  

Speaker 0: Thanks. Now, can you briefly describe what happened that led to your injury?  
Speaker 1: On May 22nd, 2025 I slipped on a wet tile floor just inside the north entrance of Riverfront Plaza Mall in Sacramento. There weren’t any caution signs out, and I went down pretty hard.  

Speaker 0: I'm sorry to hear that. What injuries did you sustain?  
Speaker 1: I twisted my left ankle and sprained my right wrist trying to catch myself. My lower back’s been sore too.  

Speaker 0: Did you receive medical treatment?  
Speaker 1: Yes. Security called an ambulance and I was taken to Mercy General Hospital the same day. They did X-rays and an MRI, put my wrist in a brace, and gave me crutches for the ankle.  

Speaker 0: Have you seen any specialists since then?  
Speaker 1: I’ve had two follow-up visits with Dr. Alan Wu, an orthopedic surgeon, and he referred me to physical therapy. I’ve done four PT sessions so far.  

Speaker 0: Understood. Are you still treating?  
Speaker 1: Yes, I have another PT appointment this Friday.  

Speaker 0: Do you have health insurance?  
Speaker 1: I do—Kaiser Permanente, policy number KPN-388-54.  

Speaker 0: And did you miss any work because of the incident?  
Speaker 1: Seven days so far. I’m a barista at Morning Brew Coffee and had to take unpaid leave.  

Speaker 0: On a scale of one to 10, what's your pain level today?  
Speaker 1: About a six, mostly in my ankle.  

Speaker 0: Got it. May I get the mall’s address if you have it?  
Speaker 1: Sure, it’s 2500 Riverside Drive, Sacramento, California 95818.  

Speaker 0: Perfect. We'll review your case right away. The next step is to send you a HIPAA release and contingency fee agreement for electronic signature so we can obtain your records and move forward. Does that sound okay?  
Speaker 1: Yes, that’s fine.  

Speaker 0: Great. You’ll receive an email with further instructions within the next few minutes. If you have any questions, reply to those messages or call me at the number in your caller ID. Anything else I can help with today?  
Speaker 1: No, that covers everything. Thank you so much.  

Speaker 0: You’re welcome, Ms. Hernandez. Take care, and we’ll be in touch soon.
