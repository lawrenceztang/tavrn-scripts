Speaker 0: Thanks. Now, can you briefly describe what happened that led to your injury?

Speaker 1: On May 07, 2025, I tripped over a loose floorboard at the entrance of a restaurant called The Rustic Table. There were no warnings or signs about the hazard.

Speaker 0: I'm sorry to hear that. What injuries did you sustain?

Speaker 1: I injured my left knee and sprained my wrist when I tried to break my fall.

Speaker 0: Did you receive medical treatment?

Speaker 1: Yes. I went to Monterey Community Hospital later that day. They did an MRI on my knee and put a brace on my wrist.

Speaker 0: Understood. Are you still treating?

Speaker 1: Yes, I'm seeing an orthopedic specialist and have physical therapy sessions scheduled.

Speaker 0: Do you have health insurance?

Speaker 1: I do. It's with Kaiser Permanente, policy number KP-1234-5678.

Speaker 0: And did you miss any work because of the incident?

Speaker 1: Yes, I missed about a week and had to use my vacation days.

Speaker 0: What is your employer's name and your position?

Speaker 1: I'm a software engineer at Tech Innovations Inc.

Speaker 0: Thanks. On a scale of one to 10, what's your pain level today?

Speaker 1: I'd say it's around a six.

Speaker 0: Got it. We're almost done. May I get the restaurant's address if you have it?

Speaker 1: It's 789 Ocean Avenue, Monterey, California 93940.

Speaker 0: Perfect. We'll review your case right away. The next step is to send you a HIPAA release and contingency fee agreement for electronic signature so we can obtain your records and move forward. Does that sound okay?

Speaker 1: Yes, that's fine.

Speaker 0: Great. You'll receive an email with further instructions within the next few minutes. If you have any questions, reply to those messages or call me at the number in your caller ID. Anything else I can help with today?

Speaker 1: No, that covers it. Thank you for your help.

Speaker 0: You're welcome, Mr. Brown. Take care, and we'll be in touch soon.
