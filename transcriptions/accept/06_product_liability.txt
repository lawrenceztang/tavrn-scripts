Speaker 0: Thanks. Now, can you briefly describe what happened that led to your injury?

Speaker 1: On May 06, 2025, I was using a new blender I purchased from KitchenPro, and the blade assembly came loose while it was running. It caused a deep cut on my hand.

Speaker 0: I'm sorry to hear that. What injuries did you sustain?

Speaker 1: I had a severe laceration on my right hand, which required stitches and has limited my hand movement.

Speaker 0: Did you receive medical treatment?

Speaker 1: Yes. I went to Stanford Hospital immediately after the incident, and they stitched up the wound. I was also referred to a hand specialist for further evaluation.

Speaker 0: Understood. Are you still treating?

Speaker 1: Yes, I have a follow-up appointment with the specialist next week.

Speaker 0: Do you have health insurance?

Speaker 1: I do. It's with UnitedHealthcare, policy number UH-1234-5678.

Speaker 0: And did you miss any work because of the incident?

Speaker 1: Yes, I missed a week of work and had to use my vacation days.

Speaker 0: What is your employer's name and your position?

Speaker 1: I'm a graphic designer at Creative Solutions.

Speaker 0: Thanks. On a scale of one to 10, what's your pain level today?

Speaker 1: It's about a six. The pain is still quite noticeable.

Speaker 0: Got it. We're almost done. May I get the store's address where you purchased the blender if you have it?

Speaker 1: Yes, it's 789 Market Street, San Francisco, California 94103.

Speaker 0: Perfect. We'll review your case right away. The next step is to send you a HIPAA release and contingency fee agreement for electronic signature so we can obtain your records and move forward. Does that sound okay?

Speaker 1: Yes, that's fine.
