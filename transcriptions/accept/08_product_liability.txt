Speaker 0: Thank you, Mr. Miller. What's the best phone number to reach you?  
Speaker 1: It's (415) 555-4349.  
Speaker 0: And an email address?  
Speaker 1: robert.miller@hotmail.com.  
Speaker 0: Great. For verification, could you give me your date of birth?  
Speaker 1: January 22nd, 1990.  
Speaker 0: Thank you. Now, can you briefly describe what happened that led to your injury?  
Speaker 1: Sure. On May 1st, 2025, I was using a new ApexPro six-quart pressure cooker. The lid suddenly blew off during cooking, spraying boiling soup onto me even though it was locked properly.  
Speaker 0: I'm sorry to hear that. What injuries did you sustain?  
Speaker 1: I got second-degree burns on my chest, left arm, and part of my hand.  
Speaker 0: Did you receive medical treatment?  
Speaker 1: Yes, I was taken by ambulance to UCSF Medical Center. After the ER visit they referred me to Dr. Hannah Lee at the Burn Clinic for ongoing care.  
Speaker 0: Understood. Are you still treating?  
Speaker 1: Yes. I have weekly dressing changes and may need a skin-graft evaluation next month.  
Speaker 0: Do you have health insurance?  
Speaker 1: I do. Kaiser Permanente HMO, policy number KP-4587-23.  
Speaker 0: And have you missed any work because of the incident?  
Speaker 1: I missed eight days and I'm on light duty for the next couple of weeks.  
Speaker 0: What is your employer's name and your position?  
Speaker 1: I'm a software engineer at Seacliff Technologies.  
Speaker 0: On a scale of one to 10, what's your pain level today?  
Speaker 1: About a six.  
Speaker 0: Got it. Could you tell me where you purchased the pressure cooker?  
Speaker 1: I bought it at the Downtown San Francisco Target, 789 Market Street, and I still have the receipt and the cooker.  
Speaker 0: Perfect. We'll review your case right away. The next step is to send you a HIPAA release and contingency fee agreement for electronic signature so we can obtain your records and move forward. Does that sound okay?  
Speaker 1: Yes, that's fine.

Speaker 1: No, that covers everything. Thank you.  
Speaker 0: You're welcome, Mr. Miller. Take care, and we'll be in touch soon.
