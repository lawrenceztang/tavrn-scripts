Speaker 1: Hi. My name is Maria Rodriguez.

Speaker 0: Thank you, Ms. Rodriguez. What's the best phone number to reach you?

Speaker 1: Sure. It's (510) 555-8412.

Speaker 0: And an email address?

Speaker 1: maria.rodriguez@gmail.com.

Speaker 0: Great. For verification, could you give me your date of birth?

Speaker 1: April 3rd, 1978.

Speaker 0: Thanks. Now, can you briefly describe what happened that led to your case?

Speaker 1: On May 26, 2025, my husband was involved in a car accident on Highway 580. A truck driver fell asleep at the wheel and collided with his car. He didn't survive the crash.

Speaker 0: I'm so sorry to hear that. Was there a police report filed?

Speaker 1: Yes, the California Highway Patrol was on the scene and filed a report.

Speaker 0: Understood. Did your husband receive any medical treatment before he passed?

Speaker 1: He was taken to Highland Hospital, but he was pronounced dead on arrival.

Speaker 0: Again, I'm very sorry for your loss. Do you have any insurance information related to the incident?

Speaker 1: Yes, we have auto insurance with State Farm, policy number SF-123456.

Speaker 0: Thank you. Were there any witnesses to the accident?

Speaker 1: Yes, there were a few drivers who stopped and gave statements to the police.

Speaker 0: And do you have any legal representation at this time?

Speaker 1: No, I don't. That's why I'm reaching out to you.

Speaker 0: I understand. We'll review your case right away. The next step is to send you a HIPAA release and contingency fee agreement for electronic signature so we can obtain the necessary records and move forward. Does that sound okay?

Speaker 1: Yes, that's fine.

Speaker 0: Great. You'll receive an email with further instructions within the next few minutes. If you have any questions, reply to those messages or call me at the number in your caller ID. Anything else I can help with today?

Speaker 1: No, that covers it. Thank you for your help.

Speaker 0: You're welcome, Ms. Rodriguez. Take care, and we'll be in touch soon.
