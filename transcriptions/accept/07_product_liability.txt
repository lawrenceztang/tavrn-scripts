Speaker 0: Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Mira Law Firm. This is Sally. May I have your full name, please?  
Speaker 1: Hi. My name is Lisa Taylor.  
Speaker 0: Thank you, Ms. Taylor. What's the best phone number to reach you?  
Speaker 1: Sure, it's (209) 555-4641.  
Speaker 0: And an email address?  
Speaker 1: lisa.taylor@proton.me.  
Speaker 0: Great. For verification, could you give me your date of birth?  
Speaker 1: August 2nd, 1990.  
Speaker 0: Thanks. Now, can you briefly describe what happened that led to your injury?  
Speaker 1: On May 10th, 2025, my pressure cooker—an InstaHome 800 Series—unexpectedly blew its lid while I was cooking. The steam release valve never engaged, and boiling soup shot out all over me.  
Speaker 0: I'm so sorry that happened. What injuries did you sustain?  
Speaker 1: I got second-degree burns on my left forearm, part of my chest, and a few splatters on my neck.  
Speaker 0: Did you receive medical treatment?  
Speaker 1: Yes. My husband drove me to Doctors Medical Center in Modesto. They cleaned the burns, gave me silvadene cream, and wrapped everything. I was referred to Dr. Raj Patel at their burn clinic.  
Speaker 0: Understood. Are you still treating?  
Speaker 1: Yes. I have weekly dressing changes and started occupational therapy for range-of-motion and scar management.  
Speaker 0: Do you have health insurance?  
Speaker 1: I do—Blue Shield PPO, policy number BS-9931-27.  
Speaker 0: And did you miss any work because of the incident?  
Speaker 1: I missed three weeks at the end of the school year and used all my sick leave.  
Speaker 0: What is your employer's name and your position?  
Speaker 1: I'm a seventh-grade science teacher at Turlock Unified School District.  
Speaker 0: Thanks. On a scale of one to ten, what's your pain level today?  
Speaker 1: About a six by the afternoon when the dressings get dry.  
Speaker 0: Got it. We're almost done. Do you have the model number or any details on the pressure cooker and where you bought it?  
Speaker 1: It’s the InstaHome 800 Series, model IH-800B. I bought it at Central Valley Home Goods, 2200 West Monte Vista Avenue, Turlock, California 95382.  
Speaker 0: Perfect. We'll review your case right away. The next step is to send you a HIPAA release and contingency fee agreement for electronic signature so we can obtain your records and move forward. Does that sound okay?  
Speaker 1: Yes, that sounds good.  
Speaker 0: Great. You'll receive an email with further instructions within the next few minutes. If you have any questions, reply to those messages or call me at the number on your caller ID. Anything else I can help with today?  
Speaker 1: No, that's everything. Thank you so much.  
Speaker 0: You're welcome, Ms. Taylor. Take care, and we'll be in touch soon.
