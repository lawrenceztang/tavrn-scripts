Speaker 0: Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Mira Law Firm. This is Sally. May I have your full name, please?  
Speaker 1: Hi, my name is Matthew Martinez.  

Speaker 0: Thank you, Mr. Martinez. What's the best phone number to reach you?  
Speaker 1: It’s (510) 555-4347.  

Speaker 0: And an email address?  
Speaker 1: matthew.martinez@hotmail.com.  

Speaker 0: Great. For verification, could you give me your date of birth?  
Speaker 1: March 2nd, 1990.  

Speaker 0: Thank you. Can you briefly describe what happened that led to your injury?  
Speaker 1: Sure. On May 23rd, 2025, I was unloading pallets at Redwood Logistics’ Oakland warehouse. A pallet was cracked, and when I lifted it with the forklift, the load shifted and a couple of thirty-pound boxes fell on my left shoulder and neck. I also twisted my lower back trying to keep the boxes from hitting a coworker.  

Speaker 0: I’m sorry to hear that. What injuries did you sustain?  
Speaker 1: Pain and stiffness in my neck and left shoulder, plus a sharp ache in my lower back.  

Speaker 0: Did you receive medical treatment?  
Speaker 1: Yes. The on-site safety manager sent me to Kaiser Permanente in Oakland that afternoon. They did X-rays and gave me muscle relaxers. I’m now seeing Dr. Alice Nguyen, an orthopedist, and doing physical therapy twice a week. I have an MRI scheduled next Wednesday.  

Speaker 0: Understood. Are you still treating?  
Speaker 1: Yes, I’m still in PT and following up with Dr. Nguyen.  

Speaker 0: Do you have health insurance?  
Speaker 1: I do—Kaiser through my union—but the workers’ comp carrier, Glendale Casualty, is supposed to cover everything.  

Speaker 0: Have you missed any work because of the incident?  
Speaker 1: I was completely off for two weeks. Since June 10th I’ve been on modified duty—no lifting over ten pounds—so my hours and overtime are down.  

Speaker 0: What is your employer’s name and your position?  
Speaker 1: Redwood Logistics; I’m a warehouse associate.  

Speaker 0: On a scale of one to 10, what’s your pain level today?  
Speaker 1: About a six in my back and a four in my shoulder.  

Speaker 0: Thank you. Did you file a workers’ compensation claim with your employer?  
Speaker 1: Yes, I filled out the DWC-1 the day after the accident. The claim number is WC-4721-89.  

Speaker 0: Perfect. We’ll review your case right away. The next step is to send you a HIPAA release and contingency fee agreement for electronic signature so we can obtain your records and move forward. Does that sound okay?  
Speaker 1: Yes, that works for me.  

Speaker 0: Great. You’ll receive an email with further instructions within the next few minutes. If you have any questions, reply to those messages or call me at the number in your caller ID. Anything else I can help with today?  
Speaker 1: No, that’s everything. Thank you for your help.  

Speaker 0: You’re welcome, Mr. Martinez. Take care, and we’ll be in touch soon.
