Speaker 0: Thanks. Now, can you briefly describe what happened that led to your injury?

Speaker 0: I'm sorry to hear that. What injuries did you sustain?

Speaker 1: I injured my left knee and sprained my wrist trying to break the fall.

Speaker 0: Did you receive medical treatment?

Speaker 1: Yes. I went to Mercy General Hospital later that day. They did an MRI and referred me to Dr. Alan Kim, an orthopedic specialist.

Speaker 0: Understood. Are you still treating?

Speaker 1: Yes. I've had two appointments with Dr. Kim and have a follow-up next week.

Speaker 0: Do you have health insurance?

Speaker 1: I do. It's with UnitedHealthcare, policy number UH-12345678.

Speaker 1: I'm a sales manager at Valley Electronics.

Speaker 0: Thanks. On a scale of one to 10, what's your pain level today?

Speaker 1: It's 5678 Central Avenue, Stockton, California 95202.

Speaker 0: Perfect. We'll review your case right away. The next step is to send you a HIPAA release and contingency fee agreement for electronic signature so we can obtain your records and move forward. Does that sound okay?
