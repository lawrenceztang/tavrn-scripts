Speaker 0: Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Mira Law Firm. This is Sally. May I have your full name, please?  
Speaker 1: Hello. My name is Sarah Martinez.  

Speaker 0: Thank you, Ms. Martinez. What's the best phone number to reach you?  
Speaker 1: It's (831) 555-3046.  

Speaker 0: And an email address?  
Speaker 1: sarah.martinez@gmail.com.  

Speaker 0: Great. For verification, could you give me your date of birth?  
Speaker 1: January 22nd, 1992.  

Speaker 0: Thanks. Now, can you briefly describe what happened that led to your injury?  
Speaker 1: Sure. On May 10th, 2025, I was riding my motorcycle southbound on Highway 1 near the Soquel Drive exit. A pickup truck changed lanes without signaling and clipped my rear wheel. I lost control and went down.  

Speaker 0: I'm sorry to hear that. What injuries did you sustain?  
Speaker 1: I fractured my left collarbone, bruised some ribs, and have road rash on my right arm and leg.  

Speaker 0: Did you receive medical treatment?  
Speaker 1: Yes. The paramedics took me to Dominican Hospital in Santa Cruz. I had X-rays, and they put my arm in a sling. I also started physical therapy last week with Dr. Andrew Kim.  

Speaker 0: Understood. Are you still treating?  
Speaker 1: Yes, PT twice a week, and I have an orthopedic follow-up in two weeks.  

Speaker 0: Do you have health insurance?  
Speaker 1: I do. It’s Anthem Blue Shield PPO, policy number ABS-4412-33.  

Speaker 0: And did you miss any work because of the incident?  
Speaker 1: I’ve missed eight days so far and I might need more time off after my next appointment.  

Speaker 0: What is your employer's name and your position?  
Speaker 1: I’m a graphic designer at Pacific Coast Advertising.  

Speaker 0: On a scale of one to 10, what's your pain level today?  
Speaker 1: Around a six, mostly in my shoulder.  

Speaker 0: Got it. Do you have the location of the accident for our records?  
Speaker 1: Yes. It was near mile marker 16 on Highway 1, just north of the Soquel Drive off-ramp in Santa Cruz, California 95065.  

Speaker 0: Thank you. We're almost done. The next step is to send you a HIPAA release and contingency fee agreement for electronic signature so we can obtain your records and move forward. Does that sound okay?  
Speaker 1: Yes, that’s fine.  

Speaker 0: Great. You'll receive an email with further instructions within the next few minutes. If you have any questions, reply to those messages or call me at the number on your caller ID. Anything else I can help with today?  
Speaker 1: No, that covers everything. Thank you so much.  

Speaker 0: You're welcome, Ms. Martinez. Take care, and we'll be in touch soon.
