Speaker 0: Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Mira Law Firm. This is Sally. May I have your full name, please?

Speaker 1: Hello. My name is Maria Brown.

Speaker 0: Thank you, Ms. Brown. What's the best phone number to reach you?

Speaker 1: It’s (831) 555-2237.

Speaker 0: And an email address?

Speaker 1: maria.brown@gmail.com.

Speaker 0: Great. For verification, could you give me your date of birth?

Speaker 1: February 9th, 1990.

Speaker 0: Thanks. Now, can you briefly describe what happened that led to your injury?

Speaker 1: Sure. On May 1st, 2025, I was riding my motorcycle southbound on Highway 1 near the Fremont Street exit in Monterey. A white SUV in the next lane drifted over without signaling and clipped my front wheel. I lost control and went down.

Speaker 0: I’m sorry that happened. What injuries did you sustain?

Speaker 1: I fractured my left collarbone, sprained my right knee, and had pretty bad road rash on my arms and shoulder.

Speaker 0: Did you receive medical treatment?

Speaker 1: Yes. An ambulance took me to Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula. They confirmed the fracture with X-rays and put my arm in a sling. Four days later I saw Dr. Steven Patel, an orthopedic surgeon, and he recommended physical therapy, which I just started last week.

Speaker 0: Understood. Are you still treating?

Speaker 1: Yes, I have PT twice a week for at least six weeks, and a follow-up with Dr. Patel in mid-June.

Speaker 0: Do you have health insurance?

Speaker 1: I do—Blue Shield HMO, policy number BS-HMO-4187-32.

Speaker 0: And did you miss any work because of the incident?

Speaker 1: Yes. I’m a graphic designer at Pacific Coast Studios, and I’ve been out for ten business days so far. It’s unpaid because I’d already used my vacation time earlier this year.

Speaker 0: On a scale of one to ten, what’s your pain level today?

Speaker 1: About a six. The collarbone aches constantly.

Speaker 0: Got it. We’re almost done. May I get the exact location of the accident for our records?

Speaker 1: It happened right where Highway 1 meets Fremont Street, Monterey, California 93940.

Speaker 0: Perfect. We’ll review your case right away. The next step is to send you a HIPAA release and contingency fee agreement for electronic signature so we can obtain your records and move forward. Does that sound okay?

Speaker 1: Yes, that’s fine.

Speaker 0: Great. You’ll receive an email with further instructions within the next few minutes. If you have any questions, reply to those messages or call me at the number in your caller ID. Anything else I can help with today?

Speaker 1: No, that covers everything. Thank you so much.

Speaker 0: You’re welcome, Ms. Brown. Take care, and we’ll be in touch soon.
