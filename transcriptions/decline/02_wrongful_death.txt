Speaker 0: Mira Intake, Maya speaking. How can I help?

Speaker 1: Hi, I'm Matthew Thomas. I'm calling about a wrongful death case involving my brother. I wanted to see if I have a case.

Speaker 0: I'm very sorry to hear about your loss, Matthew. Can you tell me what happened?

Speaker 1: Sure. On October 18, 2024, my brother was involved in a construction accident. He was working on a site when a piece of scaffolding collapsed. He didn't survive the injuries.

Speaker 0: That's tragic. Were there any witnesses to the incident?

Speaker 1: Yes, a few coworkers saw it happen. They said the scaffolding looked unstable before it fell.

Speaker 0: Was there an investigation by any authorities?

Speaker 1: Yes, OSHA came to the site and conducted an investigation. They haven't released their full report yet.

Speaker 0: Understood. Was your brother's employer aware of any safety issues prior to the accident?

Speaker 1: There were complaints about the scaffolding, but I'm not sure if they were formally reported.

Speaker 0: I see. Did your brother have any dependents or a will?

Speaker 1: He was single, no kids, and I don't think he had a will.

Speaker 0: Thank you for sharing that. What's the best contact number and email for you?

Speaker 1: Phone is (408) 555-2487. Email is matthew.thomas@gmail.com.

Speaker 0: Perfect. Matthew, we should be able to follow up within 48 hours to discuss next steps.

Speaker 1: Thank you. I appreciate it.
