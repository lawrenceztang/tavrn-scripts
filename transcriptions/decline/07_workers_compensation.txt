Speaker 0: Mira Intake, Maya speaking. How can I help?

Speaker 1: Hi, my name’s Sarah Johnson. I had a fall at work last month and wanted to see if I might need a lawyer.

Speaker 0: I’m sorry to hear that, Sarah. Can you walk me through what happened?

Speaker 1: Sure. On October 21, 2023, around 9:30 in the morning, I slipped on a wet spot near the copy room at BayVista Accounting where I’m a receptionist. I landed on my right knee.

Speaker 0: Was the incident reported to your supervisor?

Speaker 1: Yes, I filled out an incident report the same day with HR, and they sent me to an urgent care clinic.

Speaker 0: What did the clinic say?

Speaker 1: They took an X-ray—no fracture, just a contusion and mild sprain. They gave me ibuprofen and a knee brace.

Speaker 0: Any follow-up treatment?

Speaker 1: I had one physical therapy session the week after, but the therapist said I didn’t really need more unless pain persisted. It feels mostly fine now—maybe a two out of ten if I kneel.

Speaker 0: Understood. Did you miss any work?

Speaker 1: Just the rest of that day and the next morning. So, about eight hours total.

Speaker 0: Got it. Are your medical bills being covered by workers’ comp?

Speaker 1: Yes, the company’s insurance paid the urgent care and therapy. They also reimbursed my brace cost.

Speaker 0: Have you had any prior issues with that knee?

Speaker 1: Not really, just occasional soreness from jogging.

Speaker 0: Okay. What outcome are you hoping for at this point?

Speaker 1: I’m wondering if I can get a settlement for pain and suffering. My coworker said attorneys sometimes get additional money.

Speaker 0: I see. Before we wrap up, what’s the best phone number and email to reach you?

Speaker 1: Phone is (415) 555-2074 and the email’s sarah.johnson@hotmail.com.

Speaker 0: Thank you, Sarah. After reviewing the details—minimal medical treatment, full wage reimbursement, and no ongoing impairment—we unfortunately wouldn’t be able to add value to your case. It sounds like workers’ comp has already handled everything appropriately.

Speaker 1: Oh, okay. I wasn’t sure how it worked. Thanks for letting me know.

Speaker 0: Of course. If circumstances change and you experience lasting complications, feel free to reach out. Take care.

Speaker 1: Will do. Thank you.
