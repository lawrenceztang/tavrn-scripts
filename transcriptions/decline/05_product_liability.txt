Speaker 0: Mira Intake, Maya speaking. How can I help?

Speaker 1: Hi, my name’s Ashley Rodriguez. I’m calling because a kitchen appliance I bought broke and cut my hand. I’m wondering if there’s something I can do about it.

Speaker 0: I’m sorry to hear that, Ashley. Can you walk me through what happened?

Speaker 1: Sure. On May 29, 2023, I was making soup with a handheld blender—the QuickMix 500 Pro. About a minute in, the plastic guard around the blade cracked and a shard sliced the side of my left thumb.

Speaker 0: That sounds painful. Did you seek medical treatment?

Speaker 1: Yeah, I went to an urgent care the same evening. They cleaned it, gave me a tetanus shot, and put in three stitches.

Speaker 0: Do you know the total cost of the visit?

Speaker 1: It was $350. My insurance covered some, so I paid about $110 out of pocket.

Speaker 0: Understood. Any follow-up care or lasting issues?

Speaker 1: They took the stitches out two weeks later. It’s healed fine—tiny scar but no numbness or anything.

Speaker 0: Good to know. Did you miss any work because of the injury?

Speaker 1: Just the rest of that day. I’m a barista, so I clocked out early—lost maybe five hours.

Speaker 0: Do you still have the blender or any photos of it after it broke?

Speaker 1: No, I tossed it the next morning. I didn’t think to take pictures.

Speaker 0: Do you have the receipt or proof of purchase?

Speaker 1: I ordered it off HomeGoods’ website, but I can’t find the email. I paid with my debit card though.

Speaker 0: Did the product come with any warnings or instructions about temperature limits?

Speaker 1: It said something about not blending liquids above 160 degrees. The soup was probably boiling, so it was hotter than that.

Speaker 0: Thank you. Have you contacted the manufacturer or the store yet?

Speaker 1: I filled out a customer service form, but they just offered me a replacement blender.

Speaker 0: Got it. Any prior injuries to that hand we should know?

Speaker 1: No, nothing.

Speaker 0: Lastly, what’s the best phone number and email to reach you?

Speaker 1: My phone is (415) 555-9178, and my email’s ashley.rodriguez@gmail.com.

Speaker 0: Perfect. We’ll review the information and let you know our assessment within 48 hours.

Speaker 1: Thanks, I appreciate it.

Speaker 0: Of course. Take care, Ashley.
