Speaker 0: Mira Intake, Maya speaking. How can I help?

Speaker 1: Hi, I'm Robert Gonzalez. I recently had an issue with a product I purchased, and I'm wondering if I might have a case.

Speaker 0: I'm sorry to hear that, Robert. Can you tell me what happened?

Speaker 1: Sure. On August 12, 2024, I was using a new electric lawnmower I bought, and it suddenly caught fire. I managed to put it out, but it was pretty scary.

Speaker 0: That sounds concerning. Were you injured in any way?

Speaker 1: No, thankfully I wasn't hurt. I was able to move away quickly, but it did damage part of my lawn and some garden tools nearby.

Speaker 0: Did you report the incident to the manufacturer or retailer?

Speaker 1: Yes, I contacted the manufacturer. They said they'd look into it, but I haven't heard back yet.

Speaker 0: Understood. Do you have any documentation, like receipts or photos of the damage?

Speaker 1: I have the receipt and took some photos of the lawnmower and the damage it caused.

Speaker 0: That's helpful. Have you had any similar issues with other products from this company before?

Speaker 1: No, this is the first time I've had a problem like this.

Speaker 0: I see. And what's the best contact number and email for you?

Speaker 1: Phone is (650) 555-5811. Email is robert.gonzalez@proton.me.

Speaker 0: Thank you, Robert. We should be able to follow up within 48 hours to discuss next steps.

Speaker 1: Great, thank you.
