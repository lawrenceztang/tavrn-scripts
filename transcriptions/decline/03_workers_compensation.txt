Speaker 0: Mira Intake, Maya speaking. How can I help?

Speaker 1: Hi, I'm Daniel Jones. I hurt my ankle at work a little while back and wanted to see if I might have a case.

Speaker 0: I'm sorry to hear that, Daniel. Can you tell me what happened?

Speaker 1: Sure. On August 26, 2023, I was pulling a heavy pallet with a manual jack at Monterey Produce. It got caught, jerked forward, and I twisted my right ankle.

Speaker 0: Did you report it to your supervisor the same day?

Speaker 1: Yes, I told my shift lead Carlos right after it happened. He sent me to the onsite first-aid room.

Speaker 0: Was an incident report completed?

Speaker 1: They had me fill out a form and Carlos signed it. HR kept the copy.

Speaker 0: Understood. Did you get medical treatment outside the facility?

Speaker 1: Just the company clinic that afternoon. The nurse wrapped it, gave me ibuprofen, and said it was a mild sprain.

Speaker 0: Any follow-up visits, imaging, or physical therapy?

Speaker 1: No. It felt okay after about a week so I didn’t go back.

Speaker 0: Have you missed any work because of the injury?

Speaker 1: Only the weekend right after. I was back on the floor Monday.

Speaker 0: On a scale of one to ten, what’s your pain level today?

Speaker 1: Maybe a one if I step wrong, otherwise zero.

Speaker 0: Any prior issues with that ankle?

Speaker 1: I rolled it in high school basketball, but nothing since then.

Speaker 0: Have you received any workers’ comp benefits—medical bills paid, wage checks, anything like that?

Speaker 1: The clinic visit was covered, but I never got wage checks since I didn’t miss time.

Speaker 0: Do you know if a claim number was opened with the carrier?

Speaker 1: HR said they filed it, but I never saw the number.

Speaker 0: No problem. What’s the best phone and email to reach you?

Speaker 1: Phone is (831) 555-2243 and email is daniel.jones@proton.me.

Speaker 0: Thank you, Daniel. We’ll review your information and follow up within the next couple of days.

Speaker 1: Sounds good. Thanks for your help.
