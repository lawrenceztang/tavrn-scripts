Speaker 0: Mira Intake, Maya speaking. How can I help?  
Speaker 1: Hi, my name's Amanda Hernandez. I hurt my wrist at work last month and I'm wondering if I need a lawyer for workers’ comp.  
Speaker 0: I'm sorry to hear that, Amanda. Could you tell me what happened?  
Speaker 1: Sure. On November 20, 2023 I was on the packaging line at Redwood Electronics in San Mateo. I lifted a 40-pound box off a pallet and felt a sharp pain in my right wrist. It swelled up a bit.  
Speaker 0: Did you report the injury to your supervisor that day?  
Speaker 1: Not right away. I thought it was minor. I told my lead the next morning and filled out an incident form three days later.  
Speaker 0: Understood. Have you seen a doctor?  
Speaker 1: The company sent me to their clinic. Doctor said it was a mild sprain, gave me a brace and Ibuprofen. No physical therapy.  
Speaker 0: Any follow-up treatment outside the company clinic?  
Speaker 1: No, just wearing the brace. It’s already better.  
Speaker 0: Have you missed any work?  
Speaker 1: Only about four hours for the clinic visit. Since then I’ve been on light duty.  
Speaker 0: Is workers’ comp covering your medical bills and wages so far?  
Speaker 1: Yes, they paid the clinic and reimbursed the four hours.  
Speaker 0: Any prior wrist injuries we should know about?  
Speaker 1: I was diagnosed with mild carpal tunnel two years ago, but it never kept me from working.  
Speaker 0: Do you feel your employer was negligent—lack of training or faulty equipment?  
Speaker 1: No, equipment's fine. I just lifted wrong.  
Speaker 0: What outcome are you hoping for?  
Speaker 1: Mainly to make sure they don’t drop my claim if the pain comes back. People said having a lawyer helps.  
Speaker 0: Thank you. And the best phone and email for you?  
Speaker 1: Phone is (650) 555-6522, email amanda.hernandez@proton.me.  
Speaker 0: Perfect. Based on what you’ve shared, it looks like the claim is being handled properly and we wouldn’t be able to add value at this time. If anything changes, feel free to call us back.  
Speaker 1: Understood. Thanks for your time.  
Speaker 0: You're welcome, Amanda. Take care.
