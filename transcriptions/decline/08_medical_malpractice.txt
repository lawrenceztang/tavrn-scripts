Speaker 0: Mira Intake, Maya speaking. How can I help?

Speaker 1: Hi, I'm Jennifer Martinez. I believe I have a medical malpractice case and wanted to see if I might have a claim.

Speaker 0: I'm sorry to hear that, Jennifer. Can you tell me what happened?

Speaker 1: Sure. On August 25, 2024, I had a routine surgery to remove my appendix at Green Valley Hospital. A few days later, I started experiencing severe abdominal pain and fever.

Speaker 0: That sounds concerning. Did you seek further medical attention?

Speaker 1: Yes, I went back to the hospital, and they found that a surgical sponge was left inside me, which caused an infection. They had to perform another surgery to remove it.

Speaker 0: I see. Have you had any ongoing issues since the second surgery?

Speaker 1: Thankfully, the infection cleared up after a couple of weeks, but I missed work during that time and had to deal with a lot of stress and discomfort.

Speaker 0: Understood. Were there any complications or long-term effects from the incident?

Speaker 1: No long-term effects, but it was a very distressing experience, and I had to take antibiotics for a while.

Speaker 0: Thank you for sharing that. Have you spoken to anyone at the hospital about this incident?

Speaker 1: I did mention it to the hospital administration, but they just apologized and said it was a rare mistake.

Speaker 0: I appreciate the information. What's the best contact number and email for you?

Speaker 1: Phone is (925) 555-3733, and my email is jennifer.martinez@proton.me.

Speaker 0: Perfect. Jennifer, we should be able to follow up within 48 hours to discuss next steps.

Speaker 1: Thank you. I appreciate it.
