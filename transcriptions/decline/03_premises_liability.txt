Speaker 0: Mira Intake, Maya speaking. How can I help?

Speaker 1: Hi, I'm Christopher Rodriguez. I had an accident at a store a few weeks ago and I'm still dealing with some issues. I wanted to see if I might have a case.

Speaker 0: I'm sorry to hear that, Christopher. Can you tell me what happened?

Speaker 1: Sure. On July 30th, I was at a grocery store and slipped on a wet floor near the produce section. There were no warning signs. I fell and hurt my wrist and hip.

Speaker 0: Did you report the incident to the store management?

Speaker 1: Yes, I spoke with the manager right after it happened. They filled out an incident report.

Speaker 0: Were paramedics called to the scene?

Speaker 1: No, I didn't think it was necessary at the time. I went to the doctor the next day because my wrist was swollen and painful.

Speaker 0: Understood. What did the doctor say?

Speaker 1: They said it was a sprain and recommended rest and a wrist brace. I've been following up with physical therapy.

Speaker 0: Have you missed work due to the injury?

Speaker 1: Just a couple of days initially. I work as a graphic designer, so I can manage most tasks, but it's been uncomfortable.

Speaker 0: Thank you. Any prior injuries to your wrist or hip we should be aware of?

Speaker 1: No, I've never had issues with either before this.

Speaker 0: Got it. Do you have any photos or evidence from the scene?

Speaker 1: I took a picture of the wet floor and the area around it, but that's about it.

Speaker 0: That's helpful. Lastly, what's the best contact number and email for you?

Speaker 1: Phone is (408) 555-9618. Email is christopher.rodriguez@outlook.com.

Speaker 0: Perfect. Christopher, we should be able to follow up within 48 hours to discuss next steps.

Speaker 1: Great, thank you.
