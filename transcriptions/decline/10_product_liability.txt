Speaker 0: Mira Intake, Maya speaking. How can I help?

Speaker 1: Hi, my name’s David Jones. I had an issue with a pressure cooker that injured me, and I want to know if I have a case.

Speaker 0: I’m sorry to hear that, David. Could you walk me through what happened?

Speaker 1: Sure. On February 18, 2024, I was making soup in a SmartChef Pro 8-Quart electric pressure cooker. I followed the manual, but when the timer hit zero, the lid shot open and hot broth splashed onto my right forearm and hand.

Speaker 0: That sounds scary. Did you seek medical treatment?

Speaker 1: Yeah, I drove myself to John Muir Urgent Care about an hour later. The doctor said first-degree burns, gave me silver sulfadiazine cream, and wrapped it. No prescription pain meds, just ibuprofen.

Speaker 0: Understood. Any follow-up appointments?

Speaker 1: Just a quick checkup three days later to change the dressing. They said it was healing fine, no infection.

Speaker 0: On a scale from one to ten, how would you rate the pain now?

Speaker 1: Maybe a two. It’s mostly just dry skin at this point.

Speaker 0: Have you missed any work because of the injury?

Speaker 1: Not really. I took the rest of that day off, but I’m an accountant at Redwood Credit Union, so I was back at my desk the next morning with a bandage.

Speaker 0: Got it. Do you have any permanent scarring or loss of function?

Speaker 1: The doctor said it shouldn’t scar. Looks like it’s healing clean.

Speaker 0: Were there any witnesses to the incident?

Speaker 1: Just my wife—she was in the living room and heard the pop.

Speaker 0: Do you still have the pressure cooker?

Speaker 1: No, I threw it out the next day. It smelled burnt and the lid was bent.

Speaker 0: Did you take photos of the cooker or your injuries?

Speaker 1: I snapped a couple pics of my arm for work’s injury log, but none of the cooker itself.

Speaker 0: Have you contacted the manufacturer or retailer?

Speaker 1: I emailed SmartChef’s customer service. They offered me a 20-percent discount on a new unit, which felt like a slap in the face.

Speaker 0: Understood. Roughly how much have your medical expenses been so far?

Speaker 1: The urgent care visit was $185, and the follow-up was $60. My insurance hasn’t billed me yet, but that’s the sticker price.

Speaker 0: Thank you. Any prior burns or arm injuries we should be aware of?

Speaker 1: None.

Speaker 0: Last thing—best phone number and email for you?

Speaker 1: Phone’s (925) 555-6398, and email is david.jones@yahoo.com.

Speaker 0: Thank you, David. Based on the information provided, it doesn’t appear we’d be able to pursue a claim that would justify legal fees. I’m sorry, but we won’t be able to take your case.

Speaker 1: I understand. Thanks for letting me know.

Speaker 0: Of course. Take care and best of luck.

Speaker 1: You too.
