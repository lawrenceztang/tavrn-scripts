Speaker 0: Mira Intake, Maya speaking. How can I help?

Speaker 1: Hi, I'm Maria Johnson. I had a slip and fall accident recently and I'm still in pain. I wanted to see if I might have a case.

Speaker 0: I'm sorry to hear that, Maria. Can you tell me what happened?

Speaker 1: Sure. On September 29th, I was at a grocery store around 3:00 PM. I slipped on a wet floor near the produce section. There was no sign warning about the wet floor.

Speaker 0: Did you report the incident to the store management?

Speaker 1: Yes, I spoke with the manager right after it happened. They filled out an incident report.

Speaker 0: Were paramedics called to the scene?

Speaker 1: No, I didn't think I needed it at the time. But later that evening, my ankle started swelling, so I went to urgent care the next day. They said it was a sprain and gave me a brace.

Speaker 0: Understood. Have you had any follow-up treatment?

Speaker 1: Just one follow-up with my primary doctor. The pain is about a four out of 10, but it gets worse if I walk too much.

Speaker 0: Have you missed any work due to the injury?

Speaker 1: No, I work from home as a freelance writer, so I can manage my schedule around it.

Speaker 0: Thank you. Any prior issues with your ankle we should note?

Speaker 1: No, I've never had any problems with it before.

Speaker 0: Got it. Do you recall if there were any witnesses or if the store has surveillance cameras?

Speaker 1: I didn't see any witnesses, but the manager mentioned they have cameras. I haven't seen any footage though.

Speaker 0: No worries. You can follow up with them about that. Lastly, what's the best contact number and email for you?

Speaker 1: Phone is (408) 555-8677. Email is maria.johnson@yahoo.com.

Speaker 0: Perfect. Maria, we should be able to follow up within 48 hours to discuss next steps.

Speaker 1: Thank you. I appreciate it.
