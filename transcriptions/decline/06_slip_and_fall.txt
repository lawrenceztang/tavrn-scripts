Speaker 0: Mira Intake, Maya speaking. How can I help?

Speaker 1: Hi, I'm Robert Martinez. I had a slip and fall accident recently and I'm trying to see if I have a case.

Speaker 0: I'm sorry to hear that, Robert. Can you tell me what happened?

Speaker 1: Sure. On October 15th, I was at a grocery store around 3:00 PM. I slipped on a wet floor near the produce section. There were no warning signs, and I fell pretty hard.

Speaker 0: Did you report the incident to the store management?

Speaker 1: Yes, I spoke with the manager right after it happened. They filled out an incident report.

Speaker 0: Were paramedics called to the scene?

Speaker 1: No, I didn't think I needed it at the time. But later that evening, my knee started swelling up, so I went to urgent care the next day.

Speaker 0: Understood. What did the urgent care say?

Speaker 1: They said it was a sprain and gave me a knee brace and some pain medication.

Speaker 0: Have you had any follow-up treatment?

Speaker 1: Just one physical therapy session so far. The pain is about a four out of 10, but it gets worse if I walk too much.

Speaker 0: Have you missed any work due to the injury?

Speaker 1: I missed two days. I work as a sales associate at a retail store, so I'm on my feet a lot.

Speaker 0: Thank you. Any prior knee issues we should be aware of?

Speaker 1: I had a minor knee injury a few years ago, but it healed completely. This feels different.

Speaker 0: Got it. Do you have any contact information for the grocery store or their insurance?

Speaker 1: I have the store's contact, but I don't have their insurance details.

Speaker 0: No problem. You can send that information later. Lastly, what's the best contact number and email for you?

Speaker 1: Phone is (707) 555-9380. Email is robert.martinez@gmail.com.

Speaker 0: Perfect. Robert, we should be able to follow up within 48 hours to discuss next steps.

Speaker 1: Great, thank you.
