Speaker 0: Mira Intake, Maya speaking. How can I help?

Speaker 1: Hi, my name’s Matthew Garcia. I was in a motorcycle accident a couple weeks ago and wanted to see if I might have a case.

Speaker 0: I’m sorry to hear that, Matthew. Could you walk me through what happened?

Speaker 1: Sure. On September 09, 2024, around 6:30 PM, I was riding my Yamaha MT-07 on Maple Avenue. I tried to beat a yellow light, but it turned red quicker than I thought. A sedan coming from the cross street clipped my rear tire and I went down.

Speaker 0: Understood. Did the police respond?

Speaker 1: Yes, officers showed up and wrote a report—number 24090918.

Speaker 0: Were you cited at all?

Speaker 1: Yeah, they gave me a citation for running the red light.

Speaker 0: Were paramedics called to the scene?

Speaker 1: They asked if I needed an ambulance, but I refused. I had road rash and my knee felt sore, but I could stand.

Speaker 0: Did you seek medical attention later?

Speaker 1: Three days after, I went to an urgent care. They cleaned the abrasions, did X-rays—no fractures—just a mild knee sprain. They told me to rest and gave me ibuprofen.

Speaker 0: Have you had any follow-up treatment like physical therapy?

Speaker 1: Not yet. The knee’s getting better on its own, maybe a two out of ten pain now.

Speaker 0: Have you missed any work because of this?

Speaker 1: I work from home as a software tester, so no missed days—just propped my leg up while working.

Speaker 0: Any prior knee problems we should know about?

Speaker 1: I tore my ACL back in college, but that was years ago and hasn’t bothered me.

Speaker 0: Do you know the other driver’s insurance information?

Speaker 1: He had State Farm. I have the policy number on the report, but I don’t have it in front of me.

Speaker 0: No worries, you can send it later. How much damage was done to your bike?

Speaker 1: Mostly cosmetic—scratched fairing and bent brake lever. Estimate came in around $1,100.

Speaker 0: Thank you. Last thing, what’s the best contact number and email for you?

Speaker 1: Phone is (925) 555-1646, and my email’s matthew.garcia@hotmail.com.

Speaker 0: Perfect. We’ll review this and let you know our assessment within the next couple of days.

Speaker 1: Sounds good. Appreciate your time.
