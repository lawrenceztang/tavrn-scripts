Speaker 0: Mira Intake, Maya speaking. How can I help?

Speaker 1: Hi, my name’s Lisa Wilson. I had a motorcycle accident back on April 4th, 2023, and I’m wondering if I might have a case.

Speaker 0: I’m sorry to hear that, Lisa. Can you walk me through what happened?

Speaker 1: Sure. I was riding my Honda CBR on Oakdale Road heading north. Traffic was crawling, so I started lane-splitting. A pickup in the left lane drifted a little over the divider line, and when I tried to squeeze by, my handlebar clipped his mirror. I wobbled, hit the brakes too hard, and went down. The mirror cracked and my bike slid maybe ten feet.

Speaker 0: Understood. Did law enforcement respond to the scene?

Speaker 1: Yeah, CHP showed up. They took statements and gave me a ticket for unsafe speed while lane-splitting.

Speaker 0: Do you have the report number?

Speaker 1: I do—C230404-1178.

Speaker 0: Were paramedics called?

Speaker 1: They offered, but I refused. I just had a scraped knee and some soreness.

Speaker 0: Have you sought any medical treatment since then?

Speaker 1: I went to urgent care two days later because my left shoulder felt stiff. X-rays were clear; doctor said it was a mild sprain. They gave me ibuprofen and a sling I wore for a week.

Speaker 0: Any follow-up therapy or imaging?

Speaker 1: No. It actually feels fine now unless I sleep on it funny.

Speaker 0: Have you missed any time from work?

Speaker 1: Just the afternoon of the crash and the urgent care visit. I’m a dog groomer at Paws & Claws.

Speaker 0: Got it. Do you have any prior shoulder issues?

Speaker 1: None.

Speaker 0: Do you know the pickup driver’s insurance?

Speaker 1: He said he had State Farm, but since the officer said I was mainly at fault, I never filed a claim. I fixed the mirror for him out of pocket—cost me forty bucks.

Speaker 0: What about your motorcycle—any significant damage?

Speaker 1: Mostly cosmetic. Scratched fairing and a bent clutch lever. I replaced the lever myself and left the scratches.

Speaker 0: Understood. Is your own motorcycle insurance currently active?

Speaker 1: No, my policy had lapsed a week before the crash. I was planning to renew that month.

Speaker 0: I see. Lastly, what’s the best phone number and email to reach you?

Speaker 1: Phone is (209) 555-1328 and email’s lisa.wilson@hotmail.com.

Speaker 0: Thank you, Lisa. Based on the details—especially the citation for unsafe speed and the minimal injuries—it’s unlikely we could pursue a claim successfully. Unfortunately, our firm won’t be able to take this matter further.

Speaker 1: Oh, alright. I figured it might be a long shot. Thanks for letting me know.

Speaker 0: Of course. I wish you the best moving forward. Take care.

Speaker 1: You too. Bye.
