Speaker 0: Mira Intake, Maya speaking. How can I help?  
Speaker 1: Hi, my name’s Jennifer Johnson. I was in a car accident on July 09, 2023, and I’m trying to figure out if I have any kind of case.  
Speaker 0: I’m sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what happened?  
Speaker 1: Sure. It was about 3:00 PM in Fremont. I was turning left onto Fremont Boulevard as the light turned yellow. I thought I had enough time, but an SUV coming straight hit my passenger side. My bumper and hood are dented, but both cars could still drive.  
Speaker 0: Did the police come to the scene?  
Speaker 1: Yes, they did. They gave me a citation for failing to yield. The report number is 23070918.  
Speaker 0: Were any paramedics called?  
Speaker 1: No, everyone seemed okay at the time. I felt a little shaken and had some stiffness in my neck, but nothing major.  
Speaker 0: Have you received any medical treatment since then?  
Speaker 1: I went to urgent care two days later just to be safe. They said it was a mild muscle strain, told me to take ibuprofen and use a heating pad. I haven’t needed any follow-up.  
Speaker 0: Understood. On a scale of one to ten, how would you rate your pain today?  
Speaker 1: Maybe a two. It mostly flares up if I sleep funny.  
Speaker 0: Have you missed any work because of the accident?  
Speaker 1: No. I’m a receptionist at a dental office, so I’ve been able to sit and work like normal.  
Speaker 0: Do you have any prior neck or back issues?  
Speaker 1: I had a minor whiplash injury from a fender-bender five years ago, but it cleared up after some physical therapy.  
Speaker 0: Thank you. Do you know the SUV driver’s insurance company?  
Speaker 1: I believe it’s State Farm. My own carrier, GEICO, is already handling the property damage.  
Speaker 0: All right. And the best phone number and email to reach you?  
Speaker 1: Phone is (408) 555-8107, and email is jennifer.johnson@outlook.com.  
Speaker 0: Thank you, Jennifer. Based on the details—especially the citation placing fault on you and the minimal injuries—we wouldn’t be able to pursue a personal injury claim for you.  
Speaker 1: Oh, okay. I understand. Thanks for letting me know.  
Speaker 0: Of course. I’m glad you weren’t badly hurt. Take care and drive safely.  
Speaker 1: Will do. Goodbye.
