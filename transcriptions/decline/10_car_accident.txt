Speaker 0: Mira Intake, Maya speaking. How can I help?

Speaker 1: Hi, I'm Christopher Brown. I was in a car accident last month and I'm still dealing with some issues. I wanted to see if I might have a case.

Speaker 0: I'm sorry to hear that, Christopher. Can you tell me what happened?

Speaker 1: Sure. On March 19th around 3:00 PM, I was driving through an intersection when a car ran a red light and hit my passenger side. My car spun and hit a light pole. The damage is mostly to the side and front bumper.

Speaker 0: Did police come to the scene?

Speaker 1: Yes, they did. They filed a report. I have the report number if you need it.

Speaker 0: Were paramedics called?

Speaker 1: No, I didn't think I was hurt at the time. But the next day, I started feeling pain in my neck and shoulders. I went to see my doctor a week later.

Speaker 0: Understood. Any follow-up treatment?

Speaker 1: I've had a couple of physical therapy sessions. The pain is about a four out of 10, but it gets worse if I move my neck too much.

Speaker 0: Have you missed work?

Speaker 1: No, I haven't missed any work. I work from home as a freelance graphic designer.

Speaker 0: Thank you. Any prior neck or shoulder issues we should note?

Speaker 1: I had a minor neck strain a few years ago, but it was resolved. This feels different though.

Speaker 0: Got it. Do you recall the other driver's insurance company?

Speaker 1: I think it was Statewide Insurance, but I don't have their policy number with me right now.

Speaker 0: No worries. You can email it later. Last thing, what's the best contact number and email for you?

Speaker 1: Phone is (209) 555-9809. Email is christopher.brown@yahoo.com.

Speaker 0: Perfect. Christopher, we should be able to follow up within 48 hours to discuss next steps.

Speaker 1: Great, thank you.
