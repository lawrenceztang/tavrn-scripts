Speaker 0: Mira Intake, Maya speaking. How can I help?

Speaker 1: Hi, I'm Jennifer Martinez. I'm calling about a wrongful death case involving my brother. I wanted to see if I have a case.

Speaker 0: I'm very sorry to hear about your loss, Jennifer. Can you tell me what happened?

Speaker 1: Yes, on August 21, 2024, my brother was involved in a construction accident. He was working on a site when a piece of scaffolding collapsed. He didn't survive the fall.

Speaker 0: That sounds devastating. Were there any witnesses to the accident?

Speaker 1: Yes, a few of his coworkers saw it happen. They said the scaffolding looked unstable before it collapsed.

Speaker 0: Was there an investigation conducted by any authorities?

Speaker 1: Yes, OSHA came to the site and conducted an investigation. They haven't released their full report yet, but they mentioned some safety violations.

Speaker 0: Understood. Was your brother's employer aware of any issues with the scaffolding prior to the accident?

Speaker 1: I'm not sure. I heard from one of his coworkers that they had reported it, but I don't have any official documentation.

Speaker 0: I see. Do you know if your brother had any life insurance or if there are any other financial considerations we should be aware of?

Speaker 1: He did have a small life insurance policy, but it won't cover much. His family is struggling with the expenses.

Speaker 0: Thank you for sharing that. Lastly, what's the best contact number and email for you?

Speaker 1: Phone is (925) 555-7518. Email is jennifer.martinez@proton.me.

Speaker 0: Thank you, Jennifer. We will review the details and follow up with you within 48 hours to discuss the next steps.

Speaker 1: Thank you for your help.
