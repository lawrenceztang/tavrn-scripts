Speaker 0: Mira Intake, Maya speaking. How can I help?

Speaker 1: Hi, my name’s Lisa Wilson. I slipped at a grocery store a few weeks ago and my ankle’s still stiff. Wanted to see if I might have a claim.

Speaker 0: I’m sorry to hear that, Lisa. Could you walk me through what happened?

Speaker 1: Sure. It was February 4th around 3:30 in the afternoon at Valley Market on Maple Avenue. I was in the produce section and stepped on a little puddle near the misting machines. My right foot shot out and I landed on my left knee and twisted my ankle.

Speaker 0: Did you notice any warning signs or cones around the area?

Speaker 1: Yeah, there was a yellow “Caution Wet Floor” sign about five or six feet away, but it was facing the other aisle, not toward me.

Speaker 0: Understood. Did you report the fall to any store employee or manager?

Speaker 1: Not right then. I was embarrassed and thought it was just a tweak. I told customer service when I was checking out maybe fifteen minutes later. They offered ice and had me fill out an incident form.

Speaker 0: Were any photos taken of the puddle or your injuries at that time?

Speaker 1: No, I didn’t think of it. By the time I considered it, they’d already mopped the spot.

Speaker 0: Did the store create an incident report?

Speaker 1: They said they did. I haven’t gotten a copy yet.

Speaker 0: Were paramedics called or did you seek immediate medical attention?

Speaker 1: No paramedics. I went home, iced it, and the next morning it was swollen so I went to urgent care. X-rays were clear—just a mild sprain. They gave me an ace bandage and anti-inflammatories.

Speaker 0: Any follow-up treatment since then?

Speaker 1: I did one physical therapy visit, but honestly it feels better now. Maybe a two out of ten ache if I’m on my feet all day.

Speaker 0: Have you missed work because of this?

Speaker 1: I took the Monday after it happened off. I’m a part-time barista at Bean Barn, so I lost about six hours.

Speaker 0: Thank you. Any prior ankle or knee issues we should know about?

Speaker 1: I sprained the same ankle playing softball in college, but that was years ago.

Speaker 0: Got it. Do you know if the store’s insurance carrier reached out to you?

Speaker 1: A claims adjuster from Pioneer Insurance left a voicemail asking for a statement. I haven’t called back yet.

Speaker 0: Understood. Last thing—best contact number and email?

Speaker 1: Phone is (707) 555-4871. Email is lisa.wilson@outlook.com.

Speaker 0: Perfect. Lisa, we’ll review the information and get back to you within 48 hours about possible next steps.

Speaker 1: Great, thanks for your time.
