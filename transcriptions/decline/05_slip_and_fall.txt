Speaker 0: Mira Intake, Maya speaking. How can I help?

Speaker 1: Hi, I'm Ashley Martinez. I had a slip and fall accident a few weeks ago and I'm still in pain. I wanted to see if I might have a case.

Speaker 0: I'm sorry to hear that, Ashley. Can you tell me what happened?

Speaker 1: Sure. On August 15th, I was at a grocery store around 3:00 PM. I slipped on a wet floor near the produce section. There were no warning signs, and I fell pretty hard on my right side.

Speaker 0: Did anyone from the store assist you or file an incident report?

Speaker 1: Yes, a manager came over and helped me up. They filled out an incident report, and I got a copy of it.

Speaker 0: Were paramedics called to the scene?

Speaker 1: No, I was embarrassed and thought I was okay at the time. But the next day, my hip and shoulder were really sore, so I went to see my doctor.

Speaker 0: Understood. What did your doctor say?

Speaker 1: They said I have a bruised hip and a sprained shoulder. They recommended rest and gave me some pain medication.

Speaker 0: Have you had any follow-up treatment?

Speaker 1: Just a couple of physical therapy sessions so far. The pain is about a four out of 10, but it gets worse if I move too much.

Speaker 0: Have you missed any work due to the injury?

Speaker 1: No, I work from home as a freelance graphic designer, so I've been able to manage my schedule around the pain.

Speaker 0: Thank you. Any prior injuries to your hip or shoulder we should be aware of?

Speaker 1: No, I've never had issues with either before this.

Speaker 0: Got it. Do you have the store's insurance information?

Speaker 1: I don't have it with me right now, but I can get it from the incident report.

Speaker 0: No worries. You can email it to us later. Lastly, what's the best contact number and email for you?

Speaker 1: Phone is (209) 555-8271. Email is ashley.martinez@gmail.com.

Speaker 0: Perfect. Ashley, we should be able to follow up within 48 hours to discuss next steps.

Speaker 1: Great, thank you.
