Speaker 0: Mira Intake, Maya speaking. How can I help?  
Speaker 1: Hi, I’m Matthew Jones. I had a fall at a supermarket a few months ago and wanted to see if it’s something your firm can help with.  

Speaker 0: I’m sorry to hear that, Matthew. Can you tell me what happened?  
Speaker 1: Sure. On May 08, 2023, around 4 PM, I walked into a ValleyMarket in Stockton. Just inside the entrance there was a rubber floor mat that had folded over on one corner. I didn’t notice and caught my foot, slipped, and landed on my right side.  

Speaker 0: Were store employees around or did anyone witness the fall?  
Speaker 1: An employee was about twenty feet away restocking produce. He came over after I stood up, asked if I was okay, and straightened the mat. No one else really saw it.  

Speaker 0: Did they make an incident report?  
Speaker 1: They offered, but I said I was fine and needed to get home, so nothing was filled out.  

Speaker 0: Did you seek medical attention that day?  
Speaker 1: No. My ankle felt sore but I drove home. Two days later it was still stiff, so I went to urgent care. They took an X-ray—no fracture, just a mild sprain. They wrapped it and told me to ice it.  

Speaker 0: Any follow-up treatment after that?  
Speaker 1: Just one physical therapy visit the next week because the urgent care doctor recommended it. The therapist gave me exercises to do at home. I haven’t gone back since it’s mostly better now.  

Speaker 0: Understood. On a scale from one to ten, how would you rate the pain now?  
Speaker 1: Maybe a two, only if I jog.  

Speaker 0: Have you missed any work due to the injury?  
Speaker 1: No. I’m a remote IT technician, so I just kept my foot elevated while working.  

Speaker 0: Did you have any prior issues with that ankle?  
Speaker 1: I rolled it playing basketball five years ago, but it healed fine.  

Speaker 0: Do you know if there were any warning signs near the mat or entrance?  
Speaker 1: After I fell, I noticed a yellow “Caution – Wet Floor” cone about six feet away. It wasn’t exactly on top of the mat, but it was in the general entrance area.  

Speaker 0: Okay. And do you recall if the mat itself looked damaged?  
Speaker 1: It looked a bit worn on the edges. The corner had flipped up.  

Speaker 0: Thank you. What medical bills have you incurred so far?  
Speaker 1: The urgent care visit was $75 after insurance, and the PT copay was $40.  

Speaker 0: Got it. Lastly, what’s the best contact number and email for you?  
Speaker 1: Phone is (209) 555-3398. Email is matthew.jones@outlook.com.  

Speaker 0: Perfect. We’ll review the information and get back to you within the next couple of days.  
Speaker 1: Sounds good. Appreciate the time.
