Speaker 0: Mira Intake, Maya speaking. How can I help?

Speaker 1: Hi, I'm Michael Hernandez. I had a slip and fall accident a while back and I'm still dealing with some issues. I wanted to see if I might have a case.

Speaker 0: I'm sorry to hear that, Michael. Can you tell me what happened?

Speaker 1: Sure. On July 11, 2023, I was at a grocery store and slipped on a wet floor near the produce section. There were no warning signs, and I fell pretty hard on my right side.

Speaker 0: Did anyone from the store assist you or file an incident report?

Speaker 1: Yes, a manager came over and helped me up. They filled out an incident report, but I didn't get a copy.

Speaker 0: Were paramedics called to the scene?

Speaker 1: No, I didn't think I needed it at the time. But the next day, my hip and shoulder were really sore, so I went to see my doctor.

Speaker 0: Understood. What did your doctor say?

Speaker 1: They said I had a bruised hip and a sprained shoulder. They recommended rest and gave me some pain medication.

Speaker 0: Have you had any follow-up treatment?

Speaker 1: Just a couple of physical therapy sessions. The pain is about a four out of 10 now, but it was worse initially.

Speaker 0: Have you missed any work due to the injury?

Speaker 1: No, I work from home as a graphic designer, so I was able to manage.

Speaker 0: Thank you. Any prior injuries to your hip or shoulder we should be aware of?

Speaker 1: No, nothing like this before.

Speaker 0: Got it. Do you remember the name of the grocery store or their insurance details?

Speaker 1: It was a Fresh Mart, but I don't have any insurance information.

Speaker 0: No problem. You can send that over if you find it. Lastly, what's the best contact number and email for you?

Speaker 1: Phone is (831) 555-8539. Email is michael.hernandez@proton.me.

Speaker 0: Perfect. Michael, we should be able to follow up within 48 hours to discuss next steps.

Speaker 1: Great, thank you.
